# Bungee Jumping

In this simulation we are going to be showing a person bungee jumping and the physics behind it. Perhaps chaning some of the variables
to see if anything changes.

Bungee jumping as always been an activity that people find facinating. Something about playing with potential death gets people's
adrenaline going. I have not done it myself but I have heard it is a good time and not many bad things.

When it comes to bungee jumping, there are many resources avaible to us that we can use. From videos, physics and coding examples.

Does the weight of the person affect how much tension is put on the rope and how much they will recoil.
